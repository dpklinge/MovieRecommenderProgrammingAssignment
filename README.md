This project contains data, code, and analysis of three recommender systems:

    -User based
	-Item based
    -Pixie-inspired random walk



Code can be found in `Programming_Assignment-1.ipynb`, and should be run from top to bottom. Ability to run jupyter notebooks is required.

Data can be found in its original form in `u.data`, `u.item`, and `u.user`, or in a csv processed form in `ratings.csv`, `users.csv`, and `movies.csv`



An explanation of the Pixie-inspired random walk can be found in `Pixie_Algorithm_Explanation.pdf`

Overall assignment summary and report can be found in `Recommendation_Report.pdf`



Any questions can be addressed to dklingen@charlotte.edu
